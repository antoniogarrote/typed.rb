Gradual type checker for Ruby.

Example from `spec/lib/examples/monoid.rb`:

```ruby
require 'typed/runtime'

ts 'type Monoid[T]'
module Monoid

  ts '#mappend / [T] -> [T] -> [T]'
  abstract(:mappend)

  ts '#mempty / -> [T]'
  abstract(:mempty)

end


ts 'type Sum[Integer] super Monoid[T]'
class Sum

  include Monoid

  def mappend(a,b)
    a + b
  end

  def mempty
    0
  end

end


ts '#sum / Array[Integer] -> Integer'
def sum(xs)
  monoid = Sum.new
  zero = monoid.mempty
  xs.reduce(zero) { |a,b| monoid.mappend(a,b) }
end


ts '#moncat[T] / Array[T] -> Monoid[T] -> [T]'
def moncat(xs, m)
  zero = m.mempty
  xs.reduce(zero) { |a,b| m.mappend(a,b) }
end

->() {
  moncat([1,2,3], Sum.new)
}
```


## Introduction

Typed.rb is an attempt to build a gradual type checker for the Ruby programming language.

Typed.rb provides a mechanism to add type annotations to Ruby program's classes, modules and methods, and makes it possible to type-check the annotated code statically.
Types annotations has no impact on performance during the execution of the program. Typed ruby code is valid regular ruby code.
Typed.rb leverages gradual typing for Ruby, this means that typed and untyped code can be freely mixed.

In it's current implementation Typed.rb includes the following components:

- A type signature language to annotate classes, modules and methods.
- A small run-time library that introduces a few extensions to ruby core types, like the type annotations method or the application of type parameters, it introduces some new types like Boolean and Pair and the notion of abstract methods.
- Type annotations for the Ruby Standard Library.
- A gradual type checker that can be executed statically to check the provided annotations.

Typed.rb tries to typecheck most of the static subset of Ruby with as few type annotations as possible, however, due to the highly dynamic nature of Ruby some compromises need to be made and the whole dynamic set of the language, say, dynamically evaluated methods and classes cannot be type-checked.

Typed.rb is still an ongoing effort and should be considered pre-alpha.


## Type system

Typed.rb type system's matches Ruby type system with a few exceptions:

- A ```unit``` matching the runtime ```NilClass``` class has been added to the type signature language. It is inhabited by a single instalce ```nil``` and it's a subclass of all other types. ```unit``` must always be used in type signatures
- A ```dynamic``` type that by-passes type checking will be generated byt the type-checker when no typing information is available for a given method or type. Type checking untyped code will produce the ```dynamic``` type as a result. ```dynamic``` must never diractely used in a type annotation.
- A ```Boolean ``` type has been added inhabited by only two values ```true``` and ```false``` and matching both run-time classes ```TrueClass``` and ```FalseClass``` has been added to the type signature language. ```Boolean``` must always be used in type signatures
- A polymorphic ```Pair[T][U]``` extending ```Array``` type has been added to the type signature language and to the runtime. Function and blocks receiving or returning arrays of two elements can be annotated as using the ```Pair``` type
- A ```Showable``` type with no methods has been added as mixin into the ```String``` and ```Symbol``` class and can be used to annotate methods receiving an instance of any of these two classes


## Type annotations

To introduce a new type annotation, the ```BasicObject#ts``` method can be used. They can appear in any part of the source code without taking in cosideration the location of the method being annotated, however as a rule, we try to add the type annotation before the definition of the method being annotated.
The method receives a string with the type signature and returns unit. At run-time the method is a noop.

A type signature for a method is composed of the following parts:

```
Type?(#/.)method[T]* / ArgumentType? (-> ArgumentType)* (-> &BlockType)? -> ReturnType
```

For example, the type signature of the ```#ts``` method itself is ```BasicObject#ts / String -> unit```.

The main components of a type signature are:

- ```Type``` (optional), type the method belongs to. If the type part of the signature is ommitted, the current wrapping class or module is considered to be the target of the method
- ```(#/.)``` instance/class indicator. Instance level methods are prefixed with ```#```, class level methods are prefixed with ```.```
- ```method``` message this method is handling
- ```[T]*``` method type variables for polymorphic methods
- ```/``` signature separator, a fixed character ```/``` separating the method information from the actual type arguments and return type information
- ```ArgumentType? (-> ArgumentType)* -> ReturnType``` an arrow (```->```) separated list of types representing the types of the input arguments and the output type of the method

If the method has no input arguments, the only return type can be expressed with a type with an initial ```->```. For example, a method with no arguments and returning ```nil``` can be expressed as ```-> unit```.
Higher order methods accepting procs or lambdas as inputs can be expressed between parentheses ```(ArgumentType? (-> ArgumentType)* -> ReturnType)```. Methods yielding a block can be expressed with final input argument of function type prefixed with a ```&```.
For example, the ```Enumerable#map``` method from the Ruby Standard Library accepting a block and parametric on the return value of that block has the following type annotation:

```
ts '#map[E] / &([T] -> [E]) -> Array[E]'
```

Methods accepting a variable number of arguments can be expressed using a suffix ellipsis ```...``` after the type of the vararg type. For instance, a method adding any number of integers could be expressed with the following type annotation:

```
ts '#my_sum / Integer... -> Integer'
```

More than one type annotation can be provided for the same method, but the arity of the annotations must be unique. Optional blocks are taking into consideration to compute the arity of the annotation.

In order to annotate classes and modules, the ```BasicObject#ts``` method is also used. Again, the type annotation can appear in any location of the source code but by convention we try to locate them before the implementation of the type if it is available.

Type annotations are only required for polymorphic types.

The type signature for a class/module has the following components:

```
type TypeName[T]? (super BaseType[U]*)?
```

- ```type``` prefix for all type annotations
- ```TypeName``` name of the class/module
- ```[T]*``` type variables for the polymorphic type
- ```(super BaseType[U]*)?``` base polymorphic class/module for the type

## Polymorphism

Typed.rb supports annotations for polymorphic types and methods. Type variables are introduced using square brackets and a capital letter (e.g ```[T]```).
When creating an instance of a polymorphic type in your code, information about the specialization of the type variables must be provided. The Typed.rb runtime defines a version of the ```#call`` method for the ```Class``` class as a noop that can be used to pass the value of the type variables.
For example, to declare an ```Array``` of ```Integers``` the following code can be used:

```ruby
var xs = Array.(Integer).new
```
Instead of a class, a string with the description of the type variables using the same syntax as the one used in the type annotations can be used.
The previous definition could be expressed in an equivalent way using the following snippet:

```ruby
var xs = Array.('Integer').new
```

Using a string is the only option when dealing with type vars as in the following declaration:

```ruby
ts 'type Wrapper[T]'
class Wrapper

  ts '#zero / -> Array[T]'
  def zero
   Array.('[T]').new
  end

end
```

If no value for the type variables of the polymorphic type are given, the type checker will assume that ```Object``` is used.

When initiating objects using type literals, like arrays or hashes, the type checker will try to infer the type variables using the max type for the provided values in the literal:

```ruby
[1, 2, 3]    # Array[Integer]
[1, :2, '3'] # Array[Object]
```

Type boundaries can be provided for the type variables using the ```?```, ```<``` and ```>``` symbols, where ```?``` is used as type wildcard, for instance: ```[? < Integer]```, ```[? > String]```. ```[?]```.


## Type inference and minimal typing

Typed.rb will try to perform automatic type inference for the following language constructs and don't need to be annotated:

- global variables
- instance variables
- local variables
- constants
- lambda functions

To know more about the type inferance mechanism, check the implementation of the unification algorithm used by the type checker in ```lib/typed/types/polymorphism/unification.rb```.

Class and modules only need to be annotated if they are defined as polymorphic. All methods must be annotated.

## Running the type-checker

To execute the type checker, the ```bin/typed.rb``` script can be used. The script accepts a list of options and path to the entry-point of the source code to be type-checked. Currently the only option available is ```--missing-type``` that will force the type-checker to produce a warning every single time a default dynamic type is introduced due to lack of typing information.

The script will produce some error report output and return an appropriate exit value according to the result of the the check.
